Hey there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a Electrical Engineer by profession who started his journey as a Tech writer at Tecroxy back in 2019. I am a Tech Enthusiast & Photographer.

I create tech blog posts mainly about Website and Apps.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible.  You can see a full list of what I am up to on [Tecroxy](tecroxy.com).  If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to share it with your friends and give me some â™¥ .

### Tecroxy

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the explore.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.
